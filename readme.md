#Prof Rank

The course review process is broken at BC. Course evaluations are private, and PEPs? Well, PEPs is neither functional nor usable. I don't want to go through 20 steps to fill out a single review. It should be easy, dammit. And at the end of the day, it's really not about the course, is it? It's about the teacher.

Every semester, I find myself and others asking the same damn question: who should I take for **_________**? I get about ten different answers. What the heck. So what happens? I get screwed over. 

Knowing who to take and who to avoid should not cause headaches. It needs to be simple.
